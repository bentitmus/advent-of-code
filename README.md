# Advent of Code Solutions

My Advent of Code solutions for problems that I've attempted. Primarily these are
in Prolog. Inputs are encrypted but you should be able to use your own inputs
by putting them in an `inputs` directory in the year directory.

### Prolog

These solutions assume SWI Prolog is installed.

### F#

These solutions work with .NET 7.

### CIL

CIL is the .NET intermediate language. These solutions assume that .NET 7 is
installed, but also need the ILAsm assembler. This can be obtained by adding the
`runtime.<platform>.Microsoft.NETCore.ILAsm` NuGet package to a project which
will cause the assembler to be installed. You can then add `ilasm` to your
path.
